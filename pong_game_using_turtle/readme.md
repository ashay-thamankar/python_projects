# Python Pong Game üèì

Welcome to the Python Pong Game! This classic arcade game is implemented using the Turtle graphics library in Python, following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Game Overview:
- **Classes:**
  - `Ball`: Manages the behavior of the game ball.
  - `Paddle`: Controls the paddles for both players.
  - `Scoreboard`: Keeps track of the score.
  - `Main`: The main game loop and initialization.

## How to Play:
1. Run the `main.py` file to start the game.
2. Use the up and down arrow keys to control the paddles.
3. The game continues until one player reaches the score limit.

## Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics library (usually included in standard Python installations)

## Implementation Details:
- The game is implemented using Python's Turtle graphics library.
- Separate files (`ball.py`, `paddle.py`, `scoreboard.py`) contain classes for different game components.
- The `main.py` file orchestrates the game loop and initializes the classes.

Feel free to explore the code and customize the game as you like! Have fun playing Pong! üéÆ
