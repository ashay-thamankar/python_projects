# Python Snake Game üêç

Welcome to the Python Snake Game! This classic arcade game is implemented using the Turtle graphics library in Python, following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Game Overview:
- **Classes:**
  - `Snake`: Manages the behavior of the snake.
  - `Food`: Handles the generation of food items.
  - `Scoreboard`: Keeps track of the score.
  - `Main`: The main game loop and initialization.

## How to Play:
1. Run the `main.py` file to start the game.
2. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
3. The snake will grow longer each time it consumes food.
4. The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or itself.

## Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics library (usually included in standard Python installations)

## Implementation Details:
- The game is implemented using Python's Turtle graphics library.
- Separate files (`snake.py`, `food.py`, `scoreboard.py`) contain classes for different game components.
- The `main.py` file orchestrates the game loop and initializes the classes.

Feel free to explore the code and customize the game as you like! Enjoy playing Snake! üêç
