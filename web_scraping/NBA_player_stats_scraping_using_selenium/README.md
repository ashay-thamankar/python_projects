# NBA Player Stats Scraping using Selenium

## Overview

This project demonstrates web scraping with Selenium to extract NBA player statistics from the official NBA website. The scraped data is then automatically uploaded to a Google Sheets form. Later, you can retrieve the data or convert it to a CSV file for further analysis or use.

## Installation
